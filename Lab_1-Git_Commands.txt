-- From task of the previous lab, here I am giving a short description about Git commands--


    --PRIMARY COMMANDS

	* git init - Initialize a git repo
	* git add . - Add all change in The Directory
	* git commit -m "Message" - commit with a message
	* git log - List of all commits. (also can be sorted out by time)
	* git status - Changes to be committed. (The changes that were made)
	* git diff filename - show changes in the file
	* git commit -am "msg" - add and commit. (Caveat - Does not work with renaming)
	* git checkout (SHA optional) -- filename - If we need to revert the changes (If added the git reset needs to be used)
	* git commit --ament -m "msg" - Make EDITS to RECENT commit or the HEAD.
	* git commit --ammend -m "" -- Change the LAST/RECENT commit.
	* git checkout branch -- checkout the branch and make everything look like that that branch
	* git checkout -- filename or directory name -- checkout the file in previous commit and make everything look like that


--- PUSH & PULL----
	* git push -u (remote branch) (branch name we want to put) -- push the branch to remote repository
	* git clone (repo location) (any name to directory) -- make a clone to the directory of the repository we specified	 
    *git push --all -u (Pushing all branched to remote)
    *git branch -d <branch_name> (Deleting local branch)
    git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch] (Create the branch on your local machine and switch in this branch)
    *git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch] (Push the branch on github )



    ---- BRANCHING ----

	* git branch branch_name --- creates a new branch
	* git checkout branch_name --- switches to the branch_name. Actually it makes the directory like branch_name
	* git diff branch1..branch2 --- difference between branch1 and branch2
	* git branch -d branch_name --- SAFELY DELETE the branch
	* git branch -D branch_name --- UNSAFELY DELETE the branch	
	* git clean -f --- remove untracked files
	* git clean -f -d --- remove untracked directories
	* git merge branchname --- merges the branch specified with the branch currently checked in. merging will merge all the changes and then all will be committed.
	* git push origin --delete branch_name --- delete branch of remote repository
  

    *** Merging a remote branch---

	1. Merge the branch locally,
	2. then push the branch
